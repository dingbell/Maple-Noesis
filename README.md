# Maple-Noesis
This project is a recruiting app.

In this web project, I first built a dictionary type table and a dictionary value table in MySQL to make the website reusable and changeable.

Selection based on the these dictionary values(skills and academic degrees of the applicants).

I designed a schema named people-ware in the MySQL. There is a MySQL script in the branch to create the tables and some samples.
